## Inroduction
### Background
- Image Restoration
- Distortion measures: PSNR SSIM and so on
### Drawbacks
- improvement in reconstruction accuracy is not always accompanied by an improvement in visual quality.
### Contribution
- proved mathemetically that: **distortion and perceptual quality are at odds with each other.**
	- here exists a region in the perception-distortion plane, which cannot be attained regardless of the algorithmic scheme.![[Pasted image 20230330214932.png]]
	- There is a trade off between perceptual and distortion.
		- for some measures, the tradeoff is weaker than others which means this measurment is "more perceptual" (for example: perceptual loss).
- generative adversarial nets (GANs) provide a **principled way to approach the perception-distortion bound.**
## Porposed Method
- Distortion and perceptual quality![[Pasted image 20230330221358.png]]
	- problem formulation:
		- X: original signal with distribution p(x)
		- Y: distorted signal
		- $\hat{x}$: reconstructed image generated by network
	- Distortion
		- Defination: measures quantify the quality of xˆ by its discrepancy to x **less discrepancy does not represent high quality**
	- Perceptual quality
		- Defination: the degree to **which it looks like a natural image**, and **has nothing to do with its similarity to any reference image**
		- the perceptual quality of an estimator is directly related to the distance between the **distribution of its reconstructed images$P_{\hat{X}}$ and the distribution of natural images$P_{X}$ **
			- therefor, perceptual quality can be formulated by the formula below![[Pasted image 20230330221640.png]]
				- d(.,.) denote a divergence
- distortion estimates: $Y=X+N,N～ N(0,1)$![[Pasted image 20230331094135.png]]
	- MSE distortion: minimize MSE distortion does not generally lead to distribution similarity
		- as for image, minimize MSE distortion usually lead to blur
	- 0-1 distortion: attained by maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) rule
	- MMSE and MAP denoising:![[Pasted image 20230331094354.png]]
- Perception-distortion tradeoff
	- Goal: reach best perception score with a prescribede distortion level![[Pasted image 20230331114840.png]]
	- Example 1: ![[Pasted image 20230331115036.png]]
		- resoration task: X ∼ N(0, 1) and N ∼ N(0, σ_N)
		- tradeoff is more severe at the **low-distortion and at the high-perceptual quality** extremes
- Traversing the tradeoff with a GAN![[Pasted image 20230331121545.png]]
	- GAN loss: we can **traverse this tradeoff by setting the parameter lambda![[Pasted image 20230331121354.png]]
		- distortion: difference of output and original image
		- adverserial loss: s proportional to some divergence the generator and data distributions, **thus can be deemed as representation of perceptual quality**
	- WGAN estimator: achieves nearly the same perceptual quality as the random draw estimator, but with a significantly lower distortion.
## Experimental
- Distortion is measured by common FR metrics, Perceptual Quality is measured by recent NR metric by Ma et al.![[Pasted image 20230331122556.png]]
## Conclusions
- Is our metric **weak the tradeoff between distortion and perceptual ?**
	- we could weak this tradeoff by capture semantic similarity
		- but how can we illustrate this?
	- spatail domain:
		- what will **lacks of minimize distortion** leads to(content lost)
		- perscribe distortion level, avoid content loss
	- frequency domain: a kind of distribution information, improve perceptual quality
- **We conclude that image restoration algorithms should always be evaluated by a pair of NR and FR metrics, constituting a reliable, reproducible and simple method for comparison, which accounts for both perceptual quality and distortion.
